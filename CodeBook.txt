Code Book for Getting & Cleaning Data Course Project
17 March 2015

The exercise used and modified the data found in the UCI HAR Dataset folder downloaded from the course site. 

The values for the variables are described in feature_info.txt file in that folder.  The project selected out all the values of variable names including “mean” or “std”.

The dataset submitted, tidydatastep5.txt, has two new columns at the front, one for Subject and one for Activity. The Subject field is a numeric 1 to 30 representing the ID# of the person performming the tests, and the Activity field is a text description of the type of activity being measured. These variables do not have units.

The remaining columns in the tidydatastep5.txt file are the mean values of the mean and std variables described in feature_info.txt over each subject and each activity, with the same units as the original values.
